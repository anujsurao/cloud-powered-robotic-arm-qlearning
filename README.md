# Robotic Arm Self-Learning Algorithm with Cloud Integration

## Project Overview
This project implements a self-learning algorithm for a robotic arm using Q-Learning, with cloud integration for managing training data and computations. The robotic arm learns to move its end effector to a target position on a 2D grid.

## Key Features
- Reinforcement Learning : Q-Learning algorithm to enable the robot to learn from its actions.
- Cloud Integration : Manage training data and computations through cloud services.
- Visualization : Visualize the learning process and robot's movements via a web interface.
- Scalability : Use cloud resources to scale the training process.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language.
- Flask : Web framework.
- NumPy : For numerical computations.
- Matplotlib : For visualization.
- AWS/GCP/Azure : Cloud services for managing data and computations.
